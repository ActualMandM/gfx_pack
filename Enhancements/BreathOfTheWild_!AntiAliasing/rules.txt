description = It's recommended to have this pack disabled and just use the resolution pack which ships with a fixed Anti-Aliasing version. FXAA: Uses a custom FXAA variant which is customizable. Check the "GameTitleHere_!Anti-Aliasing/rules.txt" file in your graphicPack folder for info about the individual settings. ENABLED: Restores the game's 720p Anti-Aliasing, but will look broken when using any other resolution. DISABLED: Removes any Anti-Aliasing for experimenting or external injecting, which will result in jaggy lines (aliasing) on the screen.

# Subpix:
# Choose the amount of sub-pixel aliasing removal.
# This can affect sharpness.
#   1.00 - upper limit (softer)
#   0.75 - default amount of filtering
#   0.50 - lower limit (sharper, less sub-pixel aliasing removal)
#   0.25 - almost off
#   0.00 - completely off

# EdgeThreshold:
# The minimum amount of local contrast required to apply algorithm.
#   0.333 - too little (faster)
#   0.250 - low quality
#   0.166 - default
#   0.125 - high quality 
#   0.063 - overkill (slower)

# EdgeThresholdMin:
# Trims the algorithm from processing darks.
#   0.0833 - upper limit (default, the start of visible unfiltered edges)
#   0.0625 - high quality (faster)
#   0.0312 - visible limit (slower)
