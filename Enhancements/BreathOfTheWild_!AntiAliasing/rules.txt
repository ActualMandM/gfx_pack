description = This version of Anti-Aliasing only works with Cemu 1.13.0e! These packs don't work on the Cemu 1.14.0 WIP builds using the version-transcompiler (use the old Anti-Aliasing pack instead). They also don't work on Cemu 1.13.0d.

# Subpix:
# Choose the amount of sub-pixel aliasing removal.
# This can affect sharpness.
#   1.00 - upper limit (softer)
#   0.75 - default amount of filtering
#   0.50 - lower limit (sharper, less sub-pixel aliasing removal)
#   0.25 - almost off
#   0.00 - completely off

# EdgeThreshold:
# The minimum amount of local contrast required to apply algorithm.
#   0.333 - too little (faster)
#   0.250 - low quality
#   0.166 - default
#   0.125 - high quality 
#   0.063 - overkill (slower)

# EdgeThresholdMin:
# Trims the algorithm from processing darks.
#   0.0833 - upper limit (default, the start of visible unfiltered edges)
#   0.0625 - high quality (faster)
#   0.0312 - visible limit (slower)
